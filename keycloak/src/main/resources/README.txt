Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit (RHAMT) ${project.version} is an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that helps simplify migration of Java applications.

RHAMT examines application artifacts, including project source directories and applications archives, 
then produces an HTML report highlighting areas that need changes. 

RHAMT can be used to migrate Java applications from previous versions of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 
or from other containers, such as Oracle WebLogic Server or IBM WebSphere Application Server.


How Does RHAMT Simplify Migration?
-------------------------------------
    RHAMT looks for common resources and highlights technologies and known “trouble spots” when migrating applications. 
    The goal is to provide a high level view into the technologies used by the application and provide a detailed report organizations can use to estimate, 
    document, and migrate enterprise applications to Java EE and JBoss EAP.


Run RHAMT
---------------
    Open a terminal and navigate to the RHAMT_HOME directory.

    Run RHAMT against the application using the appropriate command.
    
        For Linux:
        
        $ RHAMT_HOME/run_rhamt.sh
           
        For Windows:
        
        > RHAMT_HOME/run_rhamt.bat
